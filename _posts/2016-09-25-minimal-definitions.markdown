In 2015, Alex Gil wrote a [compelling piece](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2015/05/21/user-vs-learner/) on minimal computing, or "producing our own scholarship ourselves." There, he made the following remark, "I prefer to approach minimal computing around the question 'What do we need?'" Here, I simply want to follow Gil's piece by outlining my own observations on the topic. At the moment, the definitions of minimal computing and its frameworks fascinate me, in part because they engage various histories of technology at the intersection of aesthetics and politics. They also help us grasp possibilities for future work. While what's below is rough and warrants additional detail, I hope it continues the conversation Gil so graciously began. 

So, what might we mean when we say, "minimal computing"?
