      <p class="blurb">Ed is a Jekyll theme designed for textual editors based on minimal computing principles, and focused on legibility, ease and flexibility. In other words, the technology is easier to learn or teach and can produce beautifully rendered scholarly or reading editions of texts. The resulting edition consists of static pages whose rate of decay is substantially lower than database-driven systems. As an added bonus, these static pages require less bandwith.</p>

      <p class="blurb">In this tutorial you will first learn the basics of Markdownâ€”an easy to read and write markup syntax for plain textâ€”as well as Pandoc, a command line tool that converts plain text into a number of beautifully formatted file types: PDF, .docx, HTML, LaTeX, slide decks, and more. With Pandoc as your digital typesetting tool, you can use Markdown syntax to add figures, a bibliography, formatting, and easily change citation styles from Chicago to MLA (for instance), all using plain text.</p>
