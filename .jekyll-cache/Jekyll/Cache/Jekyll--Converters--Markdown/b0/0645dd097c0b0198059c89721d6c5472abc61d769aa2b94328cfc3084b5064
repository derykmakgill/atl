I"ú<p>I‚Äôve been researching the various uses and implications of ‚Äúminimal computing.‚Äù What does it mean? According to whom? For whom? Under what assumptions? Yesterday, I wrote a rather unpolished <a href="http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2016/10/02/minimal-definitions/">thought piece on the topic</a>, but below is the tl;dr version of my observations.</p>

<p>Minimal computing appears to prompt these fundamental questions about choice and necessity: ‚ÄúWhat do we need?‚Äù (see <a href="http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2015/05/21/user-vs-learner/">Gil</a>) ‚ÄúWhat don‚Äôt we need?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat do we want?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat don‚Äôt we want?‚Äù</p>

<p>The brief definitions/perspectives below point to some interesting overlaps and tensions between the multiple aims (stated or not) of minimal computing. For now, tho, I‚Äôm listing them here without synthesis, analysis, or any assumption that the list is complete. Soon, I‚Äôll add some questions that may emerge from each definition. Feedback is welcome in the meantime. Thank you!</p>

<h2 id="minimal-consumption">Minimal Consumption</h2>

<p>Reduce arguments premised on technological progress, the early adoption/implementation of technologies, and the treatment of computing as work (to create products) in order to increase deliberation, thoroughness of research, and the likelihood of informed decisions</p>

<h2 id="minimal-obsolescence">Minimal Obsolescence</h2>

<p>Reduce turnover of technologies, standards, and formats to increase reuse and decrease waste/discards</p>

<h2 id="minimal-presence">Minimal Presence</h2>

<p>Reduce the use of laptops, desktops, and other computers in order to prototype with low-tech materials (clay, paper, pencils), decrease reliance on automation, and increase comparative studies (across digital and analog media)</p>

<h2 id="minimal-visibility">Minimal Visibility</h2>

<p>Reduce the perceived intervention of technologies to facilitate interaction as well as the production/extraction of data from those interactions/behaviors (Internet of Things)</p>

<h2 id="maximum-access">Maximum Access</h2>

<p>Reduce the use of proprietary technologies and paywalls to increase access to content, data, and/or source files</p>

<h2 id="maximum-accessibility">Maximum Accessibility</h2>

<p>Through shared guidelines and frequent user testing, reduce the use of features that are difficult to see, read, hear, translate, use, navigate, process, store, or find toward access by everyone and to also increase the overall quality and consistency of projects</p>

<h2 id="maximum-justice">Maximum Justice</h2>

<p>Reduce the use of technological, cultural, social, and economic barriers to increase entry, access, participation, and self-representation in computing and to also build systems/projects premised on social justice and difference, not white supremacy and settler colonialism</p>

<h2 id="minimal-learning-curve">Minimal Learning Curve</h2>

<p>Reduce the experience assumed or required to participate in computing and technological work</p>

<h2 id="maximum-negotiation">Maximum Negotiation</h2>

<p>Reduce the rigidity of form, composition, and use to increase the personalization, adaptability, responsiveness, and/or robustness of technologies</p>

<h2 id="minimal-internet">Minimal Internet</h2>

<p>Reduce reliance on the internet for communication, exchange, and participation to account for or privilege local conditions</p>

<h2 id="minimal-connectivity">Minimal Connectivity</h2>

<p>Reduce or eliminate the default assumption that internet access is evenly distributed in order to account for material and social conditions of communications and exchange</p>

<h2 id="minimal-surveillance">Minimal Surveillance</h2>

<p>Reduce the use of sensors, computer vision, cookies, and other tracking mechanisms to increase privacy and security and to decrease harassment and hacks</p>

<h2 id="minimal-vulnerabilities">Minimal Vulnerabilities</h2>

<p>Reduce attack vectors (e.g., cross-site scripting, SQL injections, and directory traversals) of projects to decrease likelihood of hacks and harassment</p>

<h2 id="minimal-externals">Minimal Externals</h2>

<p>Reduce dependency on external groups or mechanisms to produce, exchange, and circulate your own projects and content</p>

<h2 id="minimal-automation">Minimal Automation</h2>

<p>Reduce use of mechanisms that (magically) turn input into output in order to increase awareness of how this becomes that or how algorithms/tools make decisions</p>

<h2 id="minimal-space">Minimal Space</h2>

<p>Reduce the physical space dedicated to hardware and workstations to increase the flexible use, variability, and modularity of that space</p>

<h2 id="maximum-mobility">Maximum Mobility</h2>

<p>Reduce dependency on fixed technologies (e.g., desktops plugged into walls) to increase movement, performance, and participation across events and settings</p>

<h2 id="minimal-technical-language">Minimal Technical Language</h2>

<p>Reduce the use of specialized language to increase participation and engagement with shared technocultural problems</p>
